# <center> What is Statistics?

# <center> Statistics 

* The field of statistics concerns the science of **collecting, analyzing/modeling, interpreting** data and **communicating uncertainty** about the results
  - Data science and machine learning have enabled application to 'big data'
  
* Statistical and computational methods should not be used as "recipes" to follow --> non-robust science
  - We emphasize: rigorous understanding to perform routine statistical analysis but also foundation to follow up on specific topics
