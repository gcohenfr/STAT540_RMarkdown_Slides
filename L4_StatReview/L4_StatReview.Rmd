# <center> What is Statistics?

  
---

# <center> Statistics 

* The field of statistics concerns the science of **collecting, analyzing/modeling, interpreting** data and **communicating uncertainty** about the results
  - Data science and machine learning have enabled application to 'big data'
  
* Statistical and computational methods should not be used as generic "recipes" to follow $\rightarrow$ non-robust science

* We aim for:
  - rigorous understanding to perform routine statistical analysis
  
  - solid foundation to follow up on specific topics

# <center> Statistical Inference
A framework for generating conclusions about a population from noisy data from a sample

<center>
<img src="L4_StatReview_files/statInference.png" alt="Picture from Dr. Fowler, UW" width="700"/></center>

* Language of **probability** enables us to make *predictions* and discuss *uncertainty*
* **Statistical inference** enables us to *understand* the data and make *conclusions*
* We need both to learn from data

# <center> Review: terminology & basic concepts

* Random variables and their distributions

* Models, parameters, and their estimators

* Central Limit Theorem (CLT)

* Hypothesis Testing

---

# <center> Variables

<div class = "blue">
<b>Variable <i>(noun)</i>:</b> an element, feature, or factor that is liable to vary or change
</div>

* In statistical terminology, a **variable** is an unknown quantity that we'd like to study

* Most research questions can be formulated as 
>What's the *relationship* between two or more variables?  

---

# <center> Random variables

<div class = "blue">
<b>Random Variable (RV):</b> A variable whose value results from the measurement of a quantity that is subject to variation (e.g. the <i>outcome</i> an experiment)
</div>

  - Examples: a coin flip, a dice throw, the expression level of gene X
  
  - An RV has a *probability distribution*
  
---
  
# <center> Distributions of RVs

<div class = "blue">
<b>Probability:</b> A number assigned to an outcome/event that describes the extent to which it is likely to occur
</div>

  - Must satisfy certain rules (e.g. be between 0 and 1)
  
  - Represents the (long-term) *frequency* of an event
  
--

<div class = "blue">
<b>Probability distribution:</b> A mathematical function that maps outcomes/events to probabilities
</div>

# <center> Example experiment: Two coin tosses

.pull-left[

* **Experiment**: Toss two coins

* **Sample space**: set of all possible outcomes $S=\{TT, TH, HT, HH\}$

* **Random Variable of interest**: number of heads


* Can you think of other RVs?

# <center> Assigning probability to outcomes

.pull-left[

* Let:

  * $\omega=$ an outcome 

  * $X(\omega)=$ number of heads in $\omega$
  
* Each possible outcome is associated with a probability

* **Event:** A set of outcomes that satisfy some condition

* Each realization of the RV corresponds to an **event** (e.g. $X(\omega)=1$ corresponds to the outcomes $TH$ and $HT$ )

]

.pull-right[

|       | $\omega$  | $X(\omega)$ | Probability |
| :---: |:---------:| :-----------:| :---------: |
| TT    | ![](L4_StatReview_files/tails.png)![](L4_StatReview_files/tails.png) | 0 | 0.25 |
| TH    | ![](L4_StatReview_files/heads.png)![](L4_StatReview_files/tails.png) | 1 | 0.25 |

# Assigning probability to events

The probability distribution of the Random Variable $X$ tells us how likely each event (number of heads) is to occur in the experiment


| Event | $x$ | $P(X=x)$ |
| :-----------:| :-----------:| :---------: |
| ![](L4_StatReview_files/tails.png)![](L4_StatReview_files/tails.png) | 0 | 0.25 |
| ![](L4_StatReview_files/heads.png)![](L4_StatReview_files/tails.png) <big>, ![](L4_StatReview_files/tails.png)![](L4_StatReview_files/heads.png) | 1 | 0.50 |
| ![](L4_StatReview_files/heads.png)![](L4_StatReview_files/heads.png) | 2 | 0.25 |


<small> Note on notation: $P(X=x)$ can also be written as $P_x(x)$
